The AI engineer successfully initiated the project by first clarifying the product requirements, specifically the types of accessories, desired features, payment methods, and visual style. Following the defined development workflow, it proceeded to build a comprehensive frontend using mock data to provide an early aha moment. This involved creating several React components for product display, filtering, search, cart management, and order processing, all with the specified modern and colorful design. Once the frontend mockup was approved implicitly, the engineer transitioned to backend development. This phase involved setting up MongoDB models, implementing essential CRUD endpoints for products, cart, and orders, including a mobile payment simulation service. After backend development, thorough automated backend testing was conducted and passed successfully. The final step before this summary was the user explicitly requesting frontend testing, which aligns with the development workflow.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an online accessories e-commerce website named Darling Boutique. The primary goal is to sell various accessories, including jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, rings), fashion accessories, tech accessories (wireless earphones, Bluetooth headphones, miniature fans), and leather goods.

Key functional requirements include:
- A product catalog with high-quality images.
- Filtering capabilities (e.g., by category: Jewelry/Tech).
- Real-time search functionality.
- A functional shopping cart with quantity management.
- An order system.
- Integration with mobile payment methods specific to the region: Moov Money and Airtel Money, including phone number validation and payment simulation.
- A favorites system for products.

Visual and design requirements specify a modern, elegant, and colorful aesthetic, with sweet pink-purple gradients, fluid animations, transitions, and a responsive interface. The logo Darling Boutique was also requested to be created and integrated.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for styling, complemented by  components.
- **Data Management**: Mock data initially, transitioning to real API calls.
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with  prefix for backend endpoints.
- **Session Management**: Handling anonymous user sessions for carts.
- **Payment Simulation**: Custom service simulating mobile payment gateways.
- **Development Workflow**: Iterative approach: clarify, frontend mock, backend, testing.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   : The main React application entry point. It sets up  for navigation and initially integrated a basic API call to the backend. It was later updated to integrate core components like , , , , , and  to display the e-commerce site using mock data, and then re-updated to use real backend APIs.
-   : A new file created to store simulated product data, categories, and payment gateway information. This was crucial for demonstrating the frontend functionality before backend integration.
-   : Manages the navigation, logo (Darling Boutique), and potentially cart count display. Updated to reflect real-time cart data from backend.
-   : Displays individual product information, including image, name, price, and actions like Add to Cart or Add to Favorites. Updated to use real product data.
-   : Handles displaying items in the shopping cart, managing quantities, and removing items. Updated to interact with the backend cart API.
-   : Provides UI elements for filtering products by category and sorting options (name, price, rating). Updated to send filter/sort requests to the backend.
-   : Implements the real-time search functionality for products. Updated to query the backend product search API.
-   : Manages the checkout process, including payment method selection (Moov Money, Airtel Money) and phone number validation. Updated to send order details to the backend.
-   : New file created to encapsulate all API calls to the FastAPI backend, centralizing HTTP requests and handling error states.
-   : The main FastAPI application. It defines the core API routes (), handles CORS, and integrates with MongoDB. It was significantly expanded to include routes for products, carts, orders, and categories, utilizing the new models and services.
-   : Defines the Pydantic model for product data.
-   : Defines the Pydantic model for order data.
-   : Defines a basic Pydantic model for user data, potentially for session management or order association.
-   : Defines the Pydantic model for product categories.
-   : Implements the logic for simulating mobile payments (Moov Money, Airtel Money), including success/failure logic and phone number validation.
-   : Updated to include new dependencies required for backend functionality (e.g.,  for async MongoDB).
-   : Used to log the results of automated backend testing, confirming the functionality of all implemented APIs.

<current_work>
The Darling Boutique e-commerce application is currently in a fully functional state from a backend perspective, with its frontend integrated to use the real APIs instead of mock data. The previous AI engineer successfully:
1.  **Built the Frontend Mockup**: Created a responsive and aesthetically pleasing UI with key features like product display, search, filters, a working cart, and an order flow, using mock data for immediate user feedback. This included implementing soft, modern pink-purple gradients, animations, and transitions.
2.  **Developed the Backend**: Implemented a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. This includes , , , and  APIs.
    *   **Products**: Endpoints for retrieving all products (with filters by category, search by name/description, and sorting by price/name/rating), and retrieving a specific product by ID.
    *   **Cart**: Functionality to retrieve, add, update quantities, remove items from, and clear the shopping cart, managed per session.
    *   **Orders**: Creation of orders integrated with a mobile payment simulation service ( and ), including phone number validation.
    *   **Categories**: A structure for product categories (jewelry, tech, with sub-categories).
    *   **Data Initialization**: The backend initializes with 7 sample products.
3.  **Integrated Frontend with Backend**: All frontend components that previously used mock data now interact directly with the FastAPI backend, utilizing a dedicated  service for handling requests and errors.
4.  **Backend Testing**: All backend APIs (Products, Cart, Orders, Categories) have undergone thorough automated testing using  and were reported as 100% functional with no critical issues found.

The application is now a complete e-commerce MVP, awaiting final frontend verification.
